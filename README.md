🐱 YOLOv8 Object Detection on Cat Dataset (Inspired by Computer Vision Engineer Tutorial)
📌 Overview

This repository is part of my Computer Vision learning journey.
I implemented YOLOv8 for object detection on a cat dataset, guided by the excellent tutorial:
👉 YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection (Computer Vision Engineer)

Instead of just copy-pasting, I:

Rebuilt the project in my own way

Adapted it to a custom cat dataset

Added comments and explanations for clarity

Tweaked training parameters to experiment with performance

Documented the key steps so others (and my future self) can learn from it

🧑‍💻 What I Learned

How YOLOv8 architecture works for object detection

Dataset preparation for training (annotation, augmentation, splitting)

Training & evaluating a custom object detector in PyTorch

Visualizing predictions and interpreting model performance

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Ultralytics YOLOv8

PyTorch

OpenCV

Matplotlib
