# YOLOv8-object-detection-on-a-cat-dataset 🐱

## 📌 Overview

This repository is part of my Computer Vision learning journey.
I implemented YOLOv8 for object detection on a cat dataset, guided by the excellent tutorial:
👉 YOLOv8 Custom Object Detection (Computer Vision Engineer)
Website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9fH9OWn8YM&list=PLb49csYFtO2HGELdc-RLRCNVNy0g2UMwc&index=3&ab_channel=Computervisionengineer

Instead of just copy-pasting, I:

Rebuilt the project in my own way

Adapted it to a custom cat dataset

Added comments and explanations for clarity

Tweaked training parameters to experiment with performance

Documented the key steps so others (and my future self) can learn from it

🧑‍💻 What I Learned

How YOLOv8 architecture works for object detection

Dataset preparation for training (annotation, augmentation, splitting)

Training & evaluating a custom object detector in PyTorch

Visualizing predictions and interpreting model performance

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Ultralytics YOLOv8

PyTorch

OpenCV

Matplotlib
